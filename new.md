## Falcon

Falcon is a content management system to it's core. It doesn't bother with front-end templates or XXXX.

Falcon is broken down into three major components:

1. Content types, managed by a developer
2. Regions, managed by a developer
3. Blocks, managed by a content editor

### Content types

A content type represents a collection or category of data. It has a defined structureâ€¦

### Regions

Each content type can have one or more regions to contain the content of a post.

### Blocks

Within each region content editors can add one or more blocks
